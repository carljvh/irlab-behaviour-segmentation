# Behavior segmentation of video recordings

## Background

IRLAB Therapeutics is a Biotech company, engaged in the discovery and development of novel pharmaceuticals to treat disorders of the brain, currently focusing on Parkinsonâ€™s disease. The research is mainly based on a so-called phenotypic screening approach, in which the effects of new chemical compounds are evaluated on a system level in animal models. This approach ensures that both direct and indirect effects on different neurotransmitters and signaling pathways in the brain are captured. One important part of the evaluation involves tracking and analysis of behavioral patterns, a powerful means of capturing aberrations in brain function. The tracks recorded are used to calculate a large number of behavioral descriptor variables, which are subject to different types of multivariate statistical analysis, aiming to compare e.g. different treatments and conditions.
In addition to the current tracking, based on infrared photobeams, IRLAB is evaluating the possibilities to detect` behavioral patterns directly from video recordings to be able to capture a richer set of behavioral features and thereby increase the precision in estimation of pharmacological effects of potential new pharmaceutical drugs.

## Project description

In this project, students will study video recordings of rats during so called open-field experiments. The recordings will be segmented into three different behaviors (moving, resting and stationary movements) using raw footage and/or keypoints extracted with a previously defined model. Also, the behaviors during the stationary movement phases will be further studied and if possible classified.

Key points to consider in the project will be:
* Detect movement in video with computer vision
* Annotation of video segments
* Running deep learning inference and fine tuning of models
IRLAB will provide video recordings and help with annotation as well as an overview of available methods. If needed, IRLAB may also provide some computational resources.

## Prior knowledge

The project requires knowledge of statistical/mathematical modelling, including linear and non-linear methodologies, computer vision, and programming skills in Python.
